# Client-Side Form Validation for a Job Application Website

<p2>Objective: </p2>
Design and implement a robust client-side form validation system using 
JavaScript for a job application website. The goal is to enhance user experience by 
providing real-time feedback on the validity of input data and ensuring that all 
submitted data meets specified criteria
Features:
 User-Friendly Interface: The form should provide clear feedback to users 
about any validation errors and how to correct them.
 Real-Time Validation: Validation should occur as users interact with the 
form, providing immediate feedback on the validity of their input.
 Comprehensive Validation Rules: Validate various form fields including 
name, email, phone number, address, and resume upload.
 Custom Error Messages: Display customized error messages for different 
types of validation errors to guide users effectively.
 Submit Button State: The submit button should remain disabled until all form 
fields are valid.
 Accessibility: Ensure that the validation feedback is accessible to users with 
disabilities, such as through screen readers.
Rules & Constraints:
1. Name Field: Must not be empty and should accept only letters (no numbers 
or special characters).
2. Email Field: Must be a valid email address format (e.g., 
example@email.com).
3. Phone Number Field: Must be a valid phone number format (e.g., XXX-XXXXXXX).
4. Address Field: Must not be empty and should have a minimum length of 
characters.
5. Resume Upload: Only accept files with specific extensions (e.g., .pdf, .docx) 
and limit the file size to a maximum of 5 MB.
